Represent a discrete probability distribution. Probabilities are nonnegative
and must sum to one.

module Dist (Dist (Dist), checkProper, normalize) -- Dist(Dist) exports both type and constructor

{- Alternatively we could have used just:
 -
 - `module Dist where`
 -
 - but this would export every function, so instead we specify the functions in
 - brackets as above.

-- | Represent a discrete probability distribution. Probabilities are
--   nonnegative and must sum to one. Probability is over a list of finite
--   objects, contains a list of objects + prob of each value.

data Dist a = Dist [(a, Double)]
            deriving (Eq, Show)

-- We use the "a" above to parametrise the object. We originally had this set
-- to char and it's functions only worked on chars. Now works on any data type.
-- Lists are syntactic sugar for parametrised types.

-- the `deriving` keyword automatically creates instances for the classes
-- eclosed in parenthesis. Only some classes can be derived, in this case we
-- have the 'Eq' and 'Show' classes. 'Eq' allows us to compare 'Dist' for
-- equality (i.e. the '(==)' and '(/=)' operators.)

-- Giving 'Dist' an instance for Functor, Applicative and Monad, based on the
-- types of the functions defined in this module.

{- | The 'Functor' class is used for types that can be mapped over.
Instances of 'Functor' should satisfy the following laws:

> fmap id  ==  id
> fmap (f . g)  ==  fmap f . fmap g

The instances of 'Functor' for lists, 'Data.Maybe.Maybe' and 'System.IO.IO'
satisfy these laws.

-- | Defines 'return' and '(>>=)' for the 'Dist' Type.
--   'return' takes an ordinary value 'x' and returns a Ditribution with one
